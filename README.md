📊 Brazilian E-Commerce Data Analysis — Olist Project

🔍 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive business analytics case study based on Olist, a large Brazilian e-commerce platform. The main objective was to analyze, visualize, and extract actionable insights from a complex dataset involving sales, products, customers, sellers, and logistics.

I worked across the entire data pipeline — from data extraction using SQL to advanced analysis and interactive visualizations in Python — delivering a strategic dashboard and predictive models that provide value to both business and operational decisions.



🚀 Key Highlights

✅ SQL for relational data modeling and data extraction

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Plotly

✅ Interactive dashboards using Plotly and ipywidgets in Jupyter Notebook

✅ Clustering (K-Means) to segment sellers based on sales, customer satisfaction and delivery times

✅ Hypothesis testing to evaluate the impact of delivery time on customer satisfaction

✅ Predictive modeling to estimate revenue impact and detect patterns

✅ ROI and business KPIs calculated for deeper decision-making support

✅ Clear and data-driven insights and recommendations for operational improvements



🧠 Key Business Insights

Sellers with long average delivery times tend to receive lower review scores

Certain states show consistently higher sales volumes, impacting logistics planning

Product categories with high ROI and low delivery delays can be prioritized for growth

Segmenting sellers using clustering improves performance monitoring and strategy alignment

Predictive insights can reduce churn by targeting at-risk customer segments based on delivery metrics
